* Take two command arguments which specify and input and output file
*/

#include <string.h> /* gives strcmp -> Lab Assign (3) */

/* Quit if 2 command arguments are not present */
// I think this uses scanf

/* Count number of lines in Input File to create an array of same length */
/* Populate array with each line in the Input File */

/* Create a list that will lexicographic (alphabetic) sort the array */
/* The list will have the indices of the array elements rather than the data */

/* Tips: Use Insertion Sort as a guide, inserting 1 by 1 to do this */
/* Don't directly use Insertion Sort */

/*Print List to the Output File*/
/* Order should be -> five four one three two */
